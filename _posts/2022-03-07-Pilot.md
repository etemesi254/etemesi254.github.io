So, in spirit of getting out of my comfort zone, I'm gonna try something new.

Im gonna write a lossless compressor and decompressor, probably won't be as cool as [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd), or as impressive as [Oodle SDKS](http://www.radgametools.com/oodlecompressors.htm) and definitely not as used as [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib)

But it's a good learning experience.

That's enough to go by.

<small>BTW it's in Rust</small>
