Hi My name is Caleb, currently a student, and a programmer.

I enjoy writing fast code and love image, audio and video codecs.

Here's where I write about random stuff.

## Some random things

### 1. Tags

Tags tell you which programming language the post code examples
are in, so it's only one tag per post
